Tech Stack
Frontend (Flutter/Dart)

    Flutter (latest stable version)
    State Management: Provider
    HTTP package for API calls

Backend (Flask/Python)

    Flask (Micro web framework)
    Flask-RESTful for API structure
    SQLite or PostgreSQL for database
    Flask-CORS for handling cross-origin requests

  Installation
Backend Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/MurahJr/transaction_app.git
cd transaction-tracker/backend

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask server:
python app.py

The backend should now be running at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Frontend Setup
1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the frontend directory:
cd ../frontend

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure you have Flutter installed:
Check by running:
flutter --version

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
flutter pub get

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the app on an emulator or connected device:
flutter run

Troubleshooting

üí° Port Conflicts?

    Change the backend port by editing app.py:

    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)

üí° Issues with Flutter dependencies?

    Run:

    flutter clean
    flutter pub get

üí° Backend not connecting to frontend?

    Ensure CORS is enabled in Flask:

from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)
